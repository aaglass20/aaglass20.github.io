    <p>Our indoor sessions are all about having fun, but they're also an opportunity to build confidence. We encourage
        the girls to make the most of the many touches they’re getting—developing skills and gaining confidence along
        the way
    </p>


    <b>Things to think about</b>

        <li><input type="checkbox" checked>Communication</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" checked>Movement</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Taking Chances</h1>
    <p>We talked with the team before and at the end of the game about taking chances—giving yourself the opportunity to
        make mistakes, learn, and
        succeed. Here’s what we encourage or remind them about:</p>

    <h2>Key Reminders</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Remember 50 touches:</strong> We Always take a touch before passing.</li>
        <li><strong>Quick touch:</strong> Get in the mindset of taking one quick touch.</li>
        <li><strong>Look up:</strong> Be aware of the field and what's next.</li>
        <li><strong>Take the next action:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you can dribble, then dribble.</li>
            <li>If you can pass, then pass.</li>
            <li>If you can shoot, then shoot.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>While dribbling:</strong> Keep peeking up—assess if you’re in danger.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you’re at risk, pass or shoot just before the danger becomes too close.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>When Passing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate:</strong> Let others know where the ball is going.</li>
        <li><strong>Move after the pass:</strong> Position yourself better after each pass.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When Shooting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anticipate a follow-up:</strong> Be ready for the next play.</li>
        <li><strong>Defensive transition:</strong> Prepare to switch to defense immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Marking</h2>
    <p>
        We refer to the goalie box as the <strong>danger zone</strong>. In this danger zone, we should be so close to
        our player that we can reach out and grab their shirt.
    </p>
    <img src="images/dangerzone.jpg" alt="Danger Zone" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
    <p>
        On the indoor field, our half is practically the entire danger zone. We need to be in a constant mindset of
        staying within "shirt-grabbing" distance, ensuring that we are fully marked up in our defensive half. If the
        opposing team plays a defender up, it gives us a slight advantage; our top-position players can help while still
        keeping a vigilant eye on their defensive responsibilities.
    </p>

    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Danger zone:</strong> Treat our entire defensive half as the danger zone.</li>
        <li><strong>Marking:</strong> Any opposing player crossing half should be marked 100%, with us close enough to
            touch them.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Remember to call out who you're marking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>We Need to Win the 50/50's</h2>

    <p><strong>What is a 50/50 ball, coach?</strong></p>
    <p>A "50/50 ball" refers to a loose ball on the field that is equally accessible to players from both teams, giving
        each an approximately equal chance of gaining control.</p>

    <p>If individually we conquer anticipation and determination for a 50/50, this will elevate our team’s
        performance.</p>

    <h3>Replays by the Goalie (Goalie Possession from Out of Bounds Over End Line or Save)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On Offense:</strong> It's a scoring opportunity.</li>
        <li><strong>On Defense:</strong> It's eliminating a scoring opportunity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Creating a mentality of <em>"my ball and no one else's ball"</em> goes a long way.</p>

    <p>***On a side note, on replays we should try and create more movement off the ball to give the goalie better
        opportunities to distribute and find someone open</p>

    <h3>Offensively, You May Have Heard Me Say “Go Through the Ball”</h3>
    <p><strong>What does this mean?</strong> It means to go at the ball and not slow down.</p>

    <p><strong>In a 50/50 situation, what does this do?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creates a fearless attitude</li>
        <li>We might win a foul</li>
        <li>We show our grit</li>
        <li>We back them down</li>
        <li>We force a bad touch by them</li>
    </ul>

    <p>On offense, when their goalie has possession, we have the opportunity to create a significant advantage, much
        like the opposing team did against us. For those who played last year, we used to wait on the build-out line and
        then attack once the play began. Now, when their goalie has the ball, we want to bring that same
        anticipation.</p>

    <p>Our first priority should be to immediately find our mark and aim to be the first to every 50/50 ball. With tight
        marking and an aggressive, "every ball is my ball" mindset, we can pressure the opposing team and disrupt their
        play.</p>
