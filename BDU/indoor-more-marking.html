        Indoor soccer demands constant movement, intelligent positioning, and relentless energy. With limited space
        and fast-paced action, understanding how to position yourself both offensively and defensively is crucial
        to dominating the game. Let's press the pace and make every second on the field count!
    </p>

    <h2>Our Playing Philosophy: All-Out Attack, All-Out Defense</h2>
    <p>
        We play with <strong>6 field players</strong>—and here's the key: <strong>even the defense plays offense</strong>.
        Everyone contributes to both phases of the game. When we have possession, we attack with numbers. When we lose
        possession, we defend with intensity.
    </p>

            <h3>Force Them to Play Our Game</h3>
            <p>
                When we're on offense, if there's no one to guard, <strong>we should be pressing</strong>. Push up the
                field and become an offensive weapon. We want to force the opposing team to play at our pace—fast,
                relentless, and overwhelming.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Offensive Positioning Principles:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>At least one defender back:</strong> Maintain defensive balance with one player staying home</li>
                <li><strong>Everyone else attacks:</strong> The rest of the team pushes into space and creates offensive pressure</li>
                <li><strong>Press high:</strong> Don't sit back—make them uncomfortable with the ball</li>
                <li><strong>Push into space:</strong> Find open areas and stretch the defense</li>
                <li><strong>Quick transitions:</strong> When we win the ball, attack immediately</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Everyone Marks, Everyone Covers</h3>
            <p>
                Indoor soccer is a <strong>fast-paced game</strong>, and defense requires immediate reaction. When we
                lose possession, we all mark up instantly. No spectators—everyone has a job.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Critical Image:</strong> This shows how we mark up on defense. <strong>Everyone is covered, goal side.</strong>
            We move fast, communicate, and ensure no opponent is left open in dangerous areas.</p>

            <h3>Defensive Marking Keys:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Instant transition:</strong> As soon as we lose the ball, find your mark</li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Call out who you're marking—"I've got #5!"</li>
                <li><strong>Stay goal-side:</strong> Position yourself between your opponent and the goal</li>
                <li><strong>Quick recovery:</strong> Sprint back into defensive shape</li>
                <li><strong>Cover all threats:</strong> No one gets a free look at our goal</li>

            <h3>Don't Stand Still—Move with Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                One of the biggest mistakes players make is staying neutral when they don't have the ball.
                <strong>We need to elevate our play by constantly moving</strong>, making runs, and creating passing
                lanes for our teammates.
            </p>

                </video>
                <p><strong>Watch:</strong> This video demonstrates off-ball movement—making intelligent runs and
                switches to create opportunities.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Types of Off-Ball Runs to Master:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Horizontal runs:</strong> Move across the field to drag defenders and open up space</li>
                <li><strong>Switches:</strong> Cross from one side to another to exploit gaps in the defense</li>
                <li><strong>Checking runs:</strong> Come towards the ball to receive a pass</li>
                <li><strong>Diagonal runs:</strong> Cut into space at an angle to receive through balls</li>
                <li><strong>Overlapping runs:</strong> Sprint past a teammate to provide a passing option</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Off-Ball Movement Matters:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Creates space for teammates by pulling defenders out of position</li>
                <li>Provides passing options for the ball carrier</li>
                <li>Keeps the defense guessing and disorganized</li>
                <li>Opens up shooting and scoring opportunities</li>
                <li>Makes our attack unpredictable and dangerous</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Remember:</strong> Movement off the ball is just as important as what you do with the ball.
                Be active, be aware, and make yourself available!

    <h2>Press the Pace: The 5-Minute Rule</h2>
    <p>
        Here's our philosophy: <strong>Constantly move for 5 minutes, then sub out.</strong> We want to maximize our
        time on the field by playing at full intensity, then recovering so the next group can do the same.
    </p>

    <h3>Why the 5-Minute Rule Works:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Maximum effort:</strong> Players give 100% knowing they'll get a break</li>
        <li><strong>High tempo:</strong> We maintain relentless pressure on opponents</li>
        <li><strong>Everyone plays:</strong> Regular substitutions keep everyone engaged and fresh</li>
        <li><strong>Wear them down:</strong> Our pace becomes overwhelming for the opposition</li>
        <li><strong>Build fitness:</strong> Short, intense bursts improve conditioning over time</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box" style="background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 20px; border-left: 5px solid #1e88e5; margin: 20px 0;">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Our Goal</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin: 0;">
            Make it a goal to <strong>maximize every second on the field</strong>. When you're on, you're going full
            throttle—pressing, moving, attacking, defending. When you're off, you're recovering and preparing to do it
            again. This is how we win: with pace, intensity, and constant movement.
        </p>
