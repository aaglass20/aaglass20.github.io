  <h2>🧍‍♀️ Team Values and Identity</h2>
  <p>We played with passion, perseverance, and pride. While we knew we wouldn’t always be best friends off the field, we stood by this truth:</p>
  <blockquote>“We might not all be friends all the time, but we are friends on the soccer field.”</blockquote>
  <p>We succeeded as a team, failed as a team, and always showed up for one another.</p>
  <strong>Devils on three. One, two, three… DEVILS!</strong>
